                <p>My name is Linh and I am an aspiring web developer </p>
                <p>I initially started my career as an engineer because I liked bringing ideas and concepts to life. I believe this is still true; but in a more digital form via websites and automation. The ability to see and implement changes immediately creates endless possibilities and theres always new stuff to learn! The little hit of dopamine when I see my code works or when I've grasped a new concept has got me hooked! </p>
                <p>Outside of work, I like cooking (make a mean risotto), sport an unhealthy addiction to the team based shooter: Overwatch and spend way too much money on music festivals </p>
